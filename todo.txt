To-do:
 -we need to check if the user could participate in a challenge (which means he is in the league of the challenge)
 -display the convenient challenges for a user
 -vote who is the winner
 -check if the challenge is up , or end it if time exceeds
 -when the challenge is done,update the list of winners and losers
 -assign win,loss,draw to user profile and the ability to display it
 -get the ranking of a user in a certain league
 -update the user league based on his number of wins,draws and loses(which mean we should convert these into points )
 and based on those points some users go to a higher league, other to a league less than the first and others stay on the same league
